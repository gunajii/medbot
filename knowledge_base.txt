1. Why get vaccinated?
Influenza vaccine can prevent influenza (flu).
Flu is a contagious disease that spreads around the 
United States every year, usually between October 
and May. Anyone can get the flu, but it is more 
dangerous for some people. Infants and young 
children, people 65 years and older, pregnant 
women, and people with certain health conditions or 
a weakened immune system are at greatest risk of flu 
complications.
Pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, and ear 
infections are examples of flu-related complications. 
If you have a medical condition, such as heart 
disease, cancer, or diabetes, flu can make it worse.
Flu can cause fever and chills, sore throat, muscle 
aches, fatigue, cough, headache, and runny or stuffy 
nose. Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, 
though this is more common in children than adults.
In an average year, thousands of people in the 
United States die from flu, and many more are 
hospitalized. Flu vaccine prevents millions of 
illnesses and flu-related visits to the doctor each year.
2. Influenza vaccines
CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older 
get vaccinated every flu season. Children 6 months 
through 8 years of age may need 2 doses during a 
single flu season. Everyone else needs only 1 dose 
each flu season.
It takes about 2 weeks for protection to develop  
after vaccination.
There are many flu viruses, and they are always 
changing. Each year a new flu vaccine is made to 
protect against the influenza viruses believed to be 
likely to cause disease in the upcoming flu season. 
Even when the vaccine doesn’t exactly match these 
viruses, it may still provide some protection.
Influenza vaccine does not cause flu.
Influenza vaccine may be given at the same time as 
other vaccines.
3.  T alk with your health  
care provider
Tell your vaccination provider if the person getting 
the vaccine:
 Has had an allergic reaction after a previous 
dose of influenza vaccine, or has any severe, life-
threatening allergies
 Has ever had Guillain-Barré Syndrome (also 
called “GBS”)
In some cases, your health care provider may decide 
to postpone influenza vaccination until a future visit.
Influenza vaccine can be administered at any time 
during pregnancy. Women who are or will be 
pregnant during influenza season should receive 
inactivated influenza vaccine.
People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be 
vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill 
should usually wait until they recover before getting 
influenza vaccine.
Y our health care provider can give you more 
information.

4. Risks of a vaccine reaction
 Soreness, redness, and swelling where the shot 
is given, fever, muscle aches, and headache can 
happen after influenza vaccination.
 There may be a very small increased risk of 
Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) after inactivated 
influenza vaccine (the flu shot).
Y oung children who get the flu shot along with 
pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) and/or DTaP 
vaccine at the same time might be slightly more 
likely to have a seizure caused by fever. Tell your 
health care provider if a child who is getting flu 
vaccine has ever had a seizure.
People sometimes faint after medical procedures, 
including vaccination. Tell your provider if you feel 
dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.
As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance 
of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other 
serious injury, or death.
5.  What if there is a serious problem?
An allergic reaction could occur after the  
vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs 
of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the 
face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, 
dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the person 
to the nearest hospital.
For other signs that concern you, call your health 
care provider.
Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine 
Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). Y our 
health care provider will usually file this report, or 
you can do it yourself. Visit the V AERS website at 
www.vaers.hhs.gov or call 1-800-822-7967. VAERS 
is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff 
members do not give medical advice.
6.  The National V accine Injury 
Compensation Program
The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program 
(VICP) is a federal program that was created to 
compensate people who may have been injured by 
certain vaccines. Claims regarding alleged injury or 
death due to vaccination have a time limit for filing, 
which may be as short as two years. Visit the VICP 
website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation or 
call 1-800-338-2382 to learn about the program and 
about filing a claim.
7. How can I learn more?

Quick facts
Globally, an estimated 346 million people have diabetes. Three out of four people with diabetes live in low- and  •
middle-income countries. 
In the South-East Asia (SEA) Region, nearly 71 million were estimated to be living with diabetes in 2010 and an  •
equal number had impaired glucose tolerance. 
Nearly 3.4 million people globally and 1 million in SEA Region die from consequences of high blood sugar every  •
year.
Diabetes exacerbates major infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB), malaria and HIV/AIDS. People with  •
diabetes are three times more likely to develop TB when infected and approximately 15% of TB globally is 
thought to be due to diabetes.
What is diabetes?
Diabetes is a chronic condition that occurs when blood glucose levels remain above normal limits. This happens if the 
pancreas does not produce enough insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar) or when the body cannot effectively 
use the insulin it produces. Type 1 diabetes is due to deficient insulin production while Type 2 diabetes results from 
the body’s ineffective use of insulin. Over 90% of individuals with diabetes around the world have Type 2 diabetes. 
Gestational diabetes is the type of diabetes that is first recognized during pregnancy.
What are the causes/risk factors for diabetes?
The causes of Type 1 diabetes, while not known, may be diverse such as autoimmune, genetic or environmental. •
Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes are overweight/obesity, family history of diabetes, tobacco use, excess alcohol  •
intake, prior history of gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance and physical inactivity.
What are the symptoms of diabetes?
Type 1 diabetes: Symptoms include frequent urination (polyuria), excessive  •
thirst (polydipsia), constant hunger,  weight loss, very dry skin, vision changes 
and fatigue.
Type 2 diabetes: Symptoms may be similar to those of Type 1 diabetes, but  •
are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several 
years after onset, once complications have already arisen. Impaired glucose 
tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia are intermediate conditions and 
risk categories for future development of diabetes.
What are the complications of diabetes?
Raised blood sugar due to uncontrolled diabetes leads to serious damage to many 
of the body’s systems over time. Diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and 
stroke. Diabetic retinopathy is an important cause of blindness, and occurs as 
a result of long-term accumulated damage to small blood vessels in the retina. 
Diabetic neuropathy in the feet increases the chance of foot ulcers and eventual 
limb amputation. Diabetes is among the leading causes of kidney failure. The 
overall risk of dying among people with diabetes is at least double the risk of 
their peers without diabetes.
Diabetes
Fact Sheet
1 million die every year in  
SEA Region from  
consequences of high  
blood sugar. If uncontrolled, the 
diabetes burden will double by  
2030 in the Region.


How is diabetes diagnosed?
Early diagnosis can be accomplished through blood testing, such as fasting or random 
blood glucose test, oral glucose tolerance test, or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test. 
What is the treatment for diabetes?
Diabetes treatment involves lowering blood glucose and overall reduction in risk 
factors for diabetic complications, such as control of blood pressure and blood lipids. 
This requires lifelong care and management. Quitting tobacco use is important to avoid 
complications. Healthy eating, physical activity and monitoring blood glucose levels is 
required. In addition oral medication or insulin, or both are needed to control blood glucose levels. 
What can be done to prevent and control diabetes?
The cause of Type 1 diabetes is not known and is not preventable with current knowledge. Simple lifestyle measures 
are effective in preventing or delaying the onset of Type 2 diabetes. 
What individuals can do?
Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight. •
Be physically active – at least 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity activity on most days. More activity is  •
required for weight control.
Eat a healthy diet of three to five servings of fruit and vegetables a day and reduce sugar and saturated fats  •
intake.
Quit tobacco use. •
Avoid harmful use of alcohol. •
Test blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels regularly. •
What communities and civil societies can do?
Create and maintain safe neighbourhoods for physical activity and improve access to parks and playgrounds. •
Create awareness about diabetes, its complications and prevention. •
Identify and support high profile champions of change and community leaders who will speak strongly for the  •
needs and rights of people with diabetes.
Advocate for physical activity and healthy diets in educational institutions and workplaces. •
What the private sector can do?
Ensure that healthy and nutritious choices are available and affordable to all consumers. •
Voluntarily reduce sugar,, salt and fat content of processed foods. •
Avoid marketing unhealthy food, particularly to children. •
Ensure the availability of healthy food choices and support regular physical activity practice in the workplace. •
What governments can do?
Recognize that diabetes is an important public health and development problem.  •
Create public awareness about diet and physical activity through mass media and other means. •
Promote healthy policies and create an environment for walking, bicycling, sports and other physical activities. •
Develop and enforce policies to restrict marketing of unhealthy food products,  especially to children. •
Provide access to insulin and other essential medicines for diabetes. •
Ensure easy access to essential health-care services for early diagnosis and management of diabetes and its  •
complications.
Diabetes is affecting 
younger age groups in 
low- and middle-income 
countries and thus 
impacting productive 
years of life.

Influenza
Influenza viruses are orthomyxoviruses that cause acute 
respiratory illness, ranging from mild febrile illness 
accompanied by body aches, cough and sore throat to 
severe pneumonia, which can be complicated by bacterial 
superinfection. Influenza viruses that infect humans 
are transmitted person to person, mostly by droplets 
and aerosols from the respiratory secretions of infected 
people, and occasionally from fomites or animals. 
Influenza viruses cause seasonal influenza epidemics, 
mostly in the winter months in temperate climates and 
with less distinct seasonality in the tropics, with annual 
attack rates of 5–10% in adults and 20–30% in children 
(1). Groups at higher risk of severe illness include young 
children, pregnant woman, the elderly and those with 
underlying medical conditions. The incubation period 
is one to four days. In general, the disease burden of 
influenza in lower- and middle-income countries has 
been underestimated. A recent modelling analysis 
estimated that between 291
 
243 and 645
 
832 seasonal 
influenza-associated respiratory deaths occur annually 
(4.0–8.8 per 100
 
000 individuals) (2). Global pandemics 
of novel influenza A subtypes occur every 10–40 years, 
which can cause high mortality such as that seen during 
the 1918 “Spanish flu” influenza pandemic, estimated to 
have caused 20–40 million deaths globally.
Because influenza viruses change rapidly due to 
antigenic drift, vaccines are reformulated and delivered 
annually, commonly through seasonal campaigns. 
Licensed influenza vaccines include inactivated or 
live-attenuated influenza type A and B viruses, with 
three or four subtypes per vaccine. Inactivated 
influenza vaccines (IIV) are administered by 
injection; live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) 
are delivered as nasal spray. Only IIV’s are licensed 
for children younger than age two years. Two doses 
of influenza vaccine given four weeks apart are 
recommended during the first season a child is 
vaccinated, followed by annual vaccination before 
influenza season. Maternal influenza immunization 
during pregnancy can protect infants too young 
to be vaccinated against influenza disease through 
transplacental transfer of antibodies. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) suggests that countries 
make decisions on influenza vaccines based on local 
disease burden, resources, capacity and other health 
priorities (1).

Influenza
4
 » Establish baseline levels of activity for influenza 
and severe influenza-related disease in order to 
evaluate the impact and severity of each season 
and of future pandemic events.
 » Generate influenza data that can be used during 
focused studies to estimate influenza burden and 
help decision-makers prioritize resources and 
plan public health interventions.
 » Detect unusual and unexpected events such as 
outbreaks of influenza outside the typical season, 
severe influenza among healthcare workers, or 
clusters of vaccine failures that may herald novel 
influenza virus.
 h Virological
 » Provide candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) for 
seasonal and pre-pandemic influenza vaccine 
production. In the event of pandemic, a pre-
pandemic CVV can be used to develop a 
pandemic vaccine quickly if matching the 
pandemic virus.
 » Describe the antigenic character and genetic 
makeup of circulating viruses.
 » Identify locally circulating virus types and 
subtypes and their relationship to global and 
regional patterns.
 » Assist in developing an understanding of the 
relationship of virus strains to disease severity.
 » Monitor antiviral susceptibility of circulating 
viruses.
 » Provide a platform for evaluation of vaccine and 
other intervention effectiveness.
GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS OF SURVEILLANCE
Influenza is not targeted for global elimination/
eradication. Influenza surveillance data are mostly  
used to support national vaccination strategies and  
the development of global vaccine composition.  
Virus isolates from national surveillance programmes 
can be used to provide strain information for global 
vaccine formulation. Global and regional networks of 
influenza surveillance exist, including WHO’s Global 
Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)  
(www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/en/). 
TYPES OF SURVEILLANCE RECOMMENDED 
MINIMAL SURVEILLANCE 
Minimal suggested surveillance to monitor influenza 
includes the following characteristics:
 h Facility-based and sentinel site. Because influenza 
is endemic and has a high incidence in all regions, 
influenza surveillance is not expected or designed to 
capture every case. The site of surveillance is facility-
based, both inpatient and outpatient, based on 
the surveillance syndrome used for case detection. 
Facilities are selected for surveillance as part of a 
sentinel site network in most cases.
 h Syndromic. Influenza surveillance is most often 
done using syndromic surveillance.
 » Influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance monitors 
persons seeking care in ambulatory facilities.
 » Severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) 
surveillance monitors persons with more severe 
illness who have been admitted to hospital for 
their respiratory illness.
 » The balance between ILI and SARI surveillance 
will depend on the specific information needs 
and surveillance priorities in each individual 
country.
 h Laboratory-confirmed. Patients meeting syndromic 
case definitions should be laboratory tested for 
influenza virus because of low specificity of ILI and 
SARI for influenza infection. 
 » Testing all patients for influenza at a site is ideal, 
if feasible, but otherwise a sampling strategy 
should be implemented for selection of patients 
for testing and data collection.
 » In settings of very high incidence, such as the 
2009 H1N1 pandemic, not all detected cases 
need to be laboratory confirmed. 
 h Case-based. Case-based data is gathered from SARI 
and ILI cases from which a sample was collected.
 h Active. Surveillance officers actively detect cases in 
health facilities.


WHO  Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Surveillance Standards

Influenza
CASE DEFINITIONS AND FINAL CLASSIFICATION
The target population for influenza surveillance is all 
persons, both children and adults. In temperate climate 
zones, influenza seasonality is usually well defined. Data 
collection and reporting should occur at a minimum 
during the known influenza season and for a short 
period preceding and following the season. Year-round 
surveillance is recommended because it adds to general 
understanding of out-of-season influenza activity and 
provides essential information about the emergence of 
novel influenza strains and antiviral resistance markers.
ENHANCED SURVEILLANCE 
Enhanced surveillance would be done whenever 
surveillance activity is increased because something 
unusual is identified, such as a pandemic, or a new 
subtype is starting to circulate.
INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PATHOGENS  
UNDER SURVEILLANCE
Some sites using syndromic ILI or SARI surveillance 
will test for other respiratory pathogens, including RSV, 
pneumococcus and pertussis. Multiplex polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) testing of upper respiratory tract 
specimens is becoming more common.
SUSPECTED CASE DEFINITIONS FOR CASE FINDING
 h Influenza-like illness (ILI). An acute respiratory 
infection with the following:
» measur
ed fever of ≥ 38°C
» cough
» o
nset within the last 10 days.
 h Severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). An acute 
respiratory infection with the following:
» histor
y of fever or measured fever of ≥ 38°C
» cough
» o
nset within the last 10 days
» r
equires hospitalization.
FINAL CASE CLASSIFICATION
 h Confirmed. Patients meeting the ILI or SARI 
definitions who have laboratory confirmation of 
influenza virus infection, using one of the following 
criteria:
» conventional PCR or real-time reverse 
transcription PCR (RT-PCR)
» viral antigen detection by immunofluorescence or 
enzyme immunoassay methods 
» vir
al culture with a second identification step to
identify influenza viruses (immunofluorescence,
hemagglutination-inhibition or RT-PCR)
» f
our-fold or greater rise in antibody titre in
paired acute and convalescent sera.
 h Probable. In pandemics of novel influenza A viruses, 
a probable case is an epidemiologically-linked case, 
which is a case meeting the suspected case definition 
and epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case, 
but for which no confirmatory laboratory testing 
for influenza virus infection has been performed, 
or test results are inconclusive for a novel influenza 
A virus infection. Criteria for epidemiological 
linkage are that the patient has had contact with 
one or more persons who either have or had the 
disease, and transmission of the agent by the usual 
modes of transmission is plausible. A case may be 
considered epidemiologically linked if at least one 
person in a chain of transmission has had laboratory 
confirmation.

Influenza
6
In general, individual cases of influenza detected in surveillance do not require further investigation, apart from 
referral for clinical care, if not yet in care.
CASE INVESTIGATION 
SPECIMEN COLLECTION
SPECIMEN TYPES
 h Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs
 » For ILI cases, nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal 
swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, nasal washes, 
and combined nasal and throat swabs are 
all acceptable and have higher yield of virus 
detection than oropharyngeal specimens (throat 
swabs) alone.
 » For SARI cases, the same specimens as in 
ILI should be taken. The relative sensitivity of 
nasal versus oropharyngeal swabs is unknown 
for SARI. If patient is intubated, endotracheal 
aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be 
used where clinically indicated
 » It is important to note that if other viruses are 
being tested in addition to influenza, the optimal 
specimen type might differ. 
 » For RT-PCR, swabs should be collected using 
swabs with a synthetic tip (such as polyester or 
Dacron®) and an aluminium or plastic shaft, and 
should be submitted in viral transport medium. 
Swabs with cotton or calcium alginate tips and 
wooden shafts are not recommended.
 h Serum 
  A positive case is a fourfold or greater rise in 
neutralization antibody titer based on testing 
of an acute and a convalescent serum specimen. 
The convalescent neutralizing antibody titer must 
also be 1:80 or higher. A single serum specimen 
cannot reliably be used for the diagnosis of seasonal 
influenza virus infection (3). Collect 3–5 mL whole 
blood for serologic testing.
TIMING OF COLLECTION  
Specimens for the isolation of influenza viruses in cell 
culture and for the direct detection of viral antigens or 
nucleic acids should ideally be collected within three 
days of the onset of clinical symptoms (4). Acute-phase 
serum specimens should be taken promptly after onset 
of symptoms and no later than seven days afterwards. 
Convalescent-phase serum specimen should be collected 
two to four weeks later.
STORAGE AND TRANSPORT
Swabs should be collected, stored, and transported using 
a suitable medium (4). For PCR, if the sample cannot be 
processed within 48–72 hours, keep it at or below -70°C. 
Prevent repeated freeze/thaw cycles to maintain RNA 
integrity and virus viability. Swabs intended for the 
direct detection of viral antigens by immunofluorescence 
assay (IFA) should be kept on ice or other coolant at 
approximately 2–8°C and processed within one to two 
hours of collection. Specimens should not be frozen 
except for those sent from remote locations. Specimens 
may be rejected if they are not kept at 2–4°C (for 
≤ 4 days) or frozen at -70°C or below, or if they are 
incompletely labelled or documented.
For culture, swabs should be placed at 4°C immediately 
after collection and promptly transported to the 
laboratory, where they should be inoculated into 
susceptible cell cultures as soon as possible. If the 
specimens cannot be processed within 48 hours, they 
should be kept frozen at or below -70 °C, ideally in 
liquid nitrogen. In order to prevent loss of infectivity, 
avoid repeated freezing and thawing.
Sera may be stored at 4°C for approximately 1 week, 
but should be frozen at -20°C for periods longer than 
this. The transportation of specimens should comply 
with current WHO guidance on the transporting of 
infectious substances. Receiving laboratories in other 
countries should be notified in advance of specimens 
being sent to allow them time to arrange an import 
licence.

WHO  Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Surveillance Standards

Influenza
LABORATORY TESTING 
 h RT-PCR. RT-PCR has the highest sensitivity for 
detection and is the minimal recommended test for 
most laboratories. RT-PCR provides information to:
 » differentiate influenza virus type in symptomatic 
patients from viral RNA in respiratory specimens 
or virus culture
 » determine the subtype of influenza A viruses or 
lineage of influenza B viruses
 » presumptively identify virus in patient respiratory 
specimens or viral cultures which may be infected 
with influenza A of subtype H5 (Asian lineage)
 » detect novel or newly evolving influenza A 
viruses
 » detect antiviral resistance. 
 h Viral cultures
 » Viral cultures are used to complement the 
findings of RT-PCR, allowing detailed antigenic 
and genetic characterization of the virus.
 » For labs with resources of both RT-PCR 
and viral cultures, it is recommended to use 
a combination of both RT-PCR and virus 
isolation.
 » RT-PCR-positive specimens can be selected for 
viral culture for further antigenic and genetic 
characterization, as well as drug-susceptibility 
testing if required.
 h Sera. Haemagglutination (HA) inhibition testing, 
microneutralization assay and immunofluorescence 
antibody staining are the tests most commonly done. 
A four-fold rise in HA antibodies between acute and 
convalescent sera samples indicates acute infection.
 h Sensitivity and specificity 
 » RT-PCR has high sensitivity and specificity. 
However, individuals who received nasally 
administered influenza A vaccine may have 
positive test results for up to three days after 
vaccination. Moreover, negative results do not 
preclude influenza virus infection and should not 
be used as the sole basis for treatment or other 
management decisions. Children tend to shed 
virus more abundantly and for longer periods 
than adults. Therefore, specimens from adults 
may have lower sensitivity levels than specimens 
from children.
 » Positive and negative predictive values are 
also dependent on influenza prevalence. False 
negatives are more likely during peak activity 
when the prevalence of disease is high. False 
positives are more likely during periods of low 
influenza activity when prevalence is moderate 
to low.
ADDITIONAL TESTING
 h Subtype testing. Subtype testing of confirmed cases 
of influenza can provide useful information to global 
decisions regarding vaccine strain composition. 
 h Antiviral testing. Testing of resistance to 
neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir or 
zanamivir can provide useful information (5), 
including the background rate of resistance in 
circulating viruses. It can also help with monitoring 
treatment failures and resistance in high-risk cases. 
 h Multiple pathogen testing. ILI and SARI 
syndromic surveillance can be used to test for other 
respiratory pathogens besides influenza. Testing 
can be done serially, first testing for influenza virus, 
and if negative, then testing for other pathogens. 
Alternatively, parallel testing, particularly using 
multiplex testing platforms, is becoming more 
common. Take caution in interpreting the presence 
of pathogens in the non-sterile upper respiratory 
tract as evidence of etiology of the illness episode. 
This is particularly true of bacteria that commonly 
colonize the upper respiratory tract (for example, 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and 
Moraxella catarrhalis).
SPECIAL LABORATORY CONSIDERATIONS
 h Optimum specimen types and timing for peak viral 
levels during infections caused by a novel influenza 
A virus have not been determined. The collection 
of multiple specimens from the same patient may 
therefore be necessary to detect the virus.
 h For Member States that routinely conduct testing, 
results should be regularly reported directly to 
FluNet or though regional platforms.
 h Viruses found to have resistance to antiviral drugs 
should be shipped to WHO collaborating centres 
along with clinical information. If antiviral resistance 
is detected and confirmed among a circulating viral 
subtype that is currently predominantly susceptible

ILI surveillance) by age group
DATA COLLECTION, REPORTING AND USE
to antivirals, it is also important to investigate cases 
and contacts to determine whether the resistant  
virus is transmitting human-to-human. If so, this 
event should be reported immediately through  
the International Health Regulation focal point  
of the country. 
LABORATORY NETWORKS
Global influenza virological surveillance has been 
conducted through WHO’s Global Influenza 
Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). National 
Influenza Centres (NICs) form the backbone of the 
GISRS. They collect virus specimens in their country, 
perform preliminary analyses, and ship representative 
clinical specimens and isolated viruses to WHO 
collaborating centres for advanced antigenic and 
genetic analysis. The results form the basis for WHO 
recommendations on the composition of influenza 
vaccine each year, as well as relevant risk assessment 
activities at WHO.

Influenza
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS
Apart from novel strains or those with antiviral 
resistance, individual influenza cases are generally not 
immediately notifiable to public health authorities. Any 
case of human infection with a new influenza subtype 
or with a novel strain needs to be reported immediately 
to WHO under International Health Regulations. 
Epidemiological and virological data collected from 
sentinel sites should be reported to the national health 
authorities weekly and possibly more frequently in an 
outbreak or pandemic.
 h FluNet
 FluNet (www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/
flunet/en/) collects virological data. The data are 
provided remotely by NICs and other national 
influenza reference laboratories collaborating actively 
with GISRS. These data are also uploaded from 
WHO regional databases. Public users have real-
time access to selected data reports including tables, 
maps, and graphs at the national level, whereas 
data providers have full access to all virological 
information at the national level and by laboratory. 
The virological data entered into FluNet are critical 
for tracking the movement of viruses globally and 
interpreting the epidemiological data reported 
through FluID. 
 At the minimum, the following samples should be 
sent to the WHO collaborating centre (CC) for 
inclusion in FluNet:
 » viruses that cannot be subtyped locally (these and 
any new subtype virus should be submitted to a 
WHO CC as soon as possible for further testing)
 » any virus of a new subtype
 » a representative sample of viruses collected at the 
beginning, peak and end of each season
 » viruses from particularly severe or unusual cases
 » a sample of viruses isolated from outbreak 
investigations
 » viruses that are low reactors on the WHO 
haemagglutination inhibition test.
 h FluID
 FluID (www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_
monitoring/fluid/en/) is the WHO system used to 
share epidemiological data on influenza on a global 
level. The system complements the existing FluNet 
reporting network for virological data. Some WHO 
regional offices have created regional data entry tools 
that link directly with FluID and FluNet and can 
be used by Member States of those regions. FluID 
is able to accept data on ILI/SARI and mortality 
by age group with a consultation or population 
denominator. It allows near real-time tracking of 
respiratory disease trends regionally and globally. 
Summary data collected from FluID is publicly 
available in graphic form to all Member States 
through WHO websites. These data are combined 
with influenza virological data from FluNet.
 National aggregated epidemiological data for each 
age group to be reported to WHO via FluID include:
 » number of new influenza-positive ILI and SARI 
cases during the week reported
 » number of total new outpatient visits in 
outpatient clinics where ILI surveillance is being 
conducted, or the catchment population to the 
sentinel site, during the week reported
 » number of total new hospital admissions 
on wards where SARI surveillance is being 
conducted during the week reported
 » number of ILI or SARI cases sampled during the 
week reported
 » proportion of ILI and SARI specimens testing 
positive during the week reported
 » total number of inpatient respiratory deaths 
during the week being reported.
 h International Health Regulations (IHR)
 IHR requires that all cases of new subtype human 
influenza be reported to WHO. Once there is 
credible reason to believe that an animal or human-
animal influenza virus has evolved that is capable 
of sustained human transmission in a community, 
the IHR give the Director-General of WHO the 
authority to determine if the event constitutes a 
Public Health Event of International Concern. 
If antiviral resistance is detected and confirmed, 
it is also important to document through careful 
investigation of cases and contacts whether or not 
human-to human transmission has occurred. If 
sustained human-to-human transmission of resistant 
viruses is noted in contexts where the circulating 
viruses of that subtype have been predominately 
sensitive, this event should be reported immediately 
through the IHR focal point of the country.

RECOMMENDED DATA ANAL YSES 
Minimum data analysis
 h The number of SARI/ILI overall and stratified by 
age; the minimum age groups are < 5 years and ≥ 5 
years. However, the following age categories could 
be used:
 » 0 to < 2 years
 » 2 to < 5 years
 » 5 to < 15 years
 » 15 to < 50 years
 » 50 to < 65 years
 » ≥ 65 years.
 h The distribution of SARI/ILI by influenza type and 
subtype [for example, A(H3N2), A(H1N1) and B] 
by week
 h The distribution of SARI/ILI by etiology, including 
influenza by week (if testing for other etiologies is 
routinely done)
 h The percentage of SARI/ILI associated with 
influenza virus (and other respiratory pathogens if 
tested for), stratified by age
 h The percentage of SARI/ILI associated with 
influenza stratified by week or month of surveillance; 
typically reporting is more frequent (often weekly) 
during peak influenza transmission season
 h The number of deaths associated with influenza
 h Calculation of the above data by year of surveillance
ENHANCED ANAL YSES FOR SOME  
SURVEILLANCE SETTINGS
 h Morbidity burden due to influenza-associated 
respiratory infections and proportional contribution 
of influenza to respiratory infections (6).
 h For population-based surveillance, the rates of ILI 
and SARI per 100 000 population per year in the 
surveillance population overall and by age groups. 
Comparison to historical averages will likely give the 
first indications of the severity of a pandemic as it 
unfolds (7).
 h Seroprevalence of influenza antibodies in the 
populations, if serology is being done.
 h Spatial differences. Assess the timing of peak 
influenza activity at the individual surveillance sites 
in country. 
 h Case-control study for vaccine effectiveness. 
The most common method of evaluating vaccine 
effectiveness is the test-negative control design, 
which minimizes bias. The test-negative design is 
described elsewhere (8).
USING DATA FOR DECISION-MAKING
 h Monitor the distribution of SARI/ILI cases by 
age categories to alert healthcare professionals to 
anticipate disease in clinics and hospitals and to 
inform disease burden. 
 h Evaluate the distribution of SARI/ILI by influenza 
type and subtype to guide vaccine choice and 
selection of appropriate viruses globally. 
 h Monitor the disease burden to assess immunization 
programme strategy, such as timing and type of 
vaccine.
 h Monitor changes in antiviral sensitivity of influenza 
viruses to inform appropriate use of antiviral 
therapies. 
 h Monitor the case-fatality ratio, and if it is high, 
determine the causes (e.g., poor/late diagnosis, 
poor case management, poor/late access to care, and 
underlying conditions).
 h Identify the underlying risk factors (co-morbidities) 
that are associated with severe disease, to improve 
clinical management and prevention of disease in 
high-risk patients, as well as to identify those as 
priority groups for vaccination and treatment. 
 h Evaluate the distribution of SARI/ILI associated 
with influenza stratified by epidemiological week 
and by age categories, to estimate the contribution 
of influenza to respiratory disease burden nationally 
and globally, and to establish epidemic thresholds 
for comparison of disease severity between years and 
localities. 
 h Detect unusual events such as outbreaks of influenza 
outside of the typical season or clusters of vaccine 
failures, to alert IHR focal points about potential 
public health events of international concern.

Treatment of influenza infection includes supportive care 
such as antipyretics and supplemental oxygen as needed. 
Antiviral treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g., 
oseltamavir, zanamivir, amantadine, and ramantadine) 
have been shown to reduce hospitalization and mortality 
if given early in the course of illness (5). Prophylactic use 
of antivirals is not recommended due to concerns about 
resistance development.
CLINICAL CASE MANAGEMENT
Contact tracing is not usually done for seasonal 
influenza. The exception is the detection of a rare or 
highly virulent strain such as H5N1 or H7N9. In that 
case, obtain exposure history and assess and follow up 
with others at risk. Antiviral prophylaxis of contacts is 
not routinely used .
CONTACT TRACING AND MANAGEMENT
SURVEILLANCE, INVESTIGATION AND RESPONSE  
IN OUTBREAK SETTINGS
DEFINITION OF AN OUTBREAK
There is no standard definition for an outbreak of 
seasonal influenza, which usually occurs in annual 
epidemics. The term outbreak is more often used for 
the appearance of cases of a novel or emerging strain of 
influenza. A single case of a novel strain should trigger 
a public health response. Seasonal influenza is usually 
evaluated as levels of influenza activity (9). Participating 
countries in FluNet report their influenza activity levels 
as the following (7):
 h no activity – no influenza viral isolates or clinical 
signs of influenza activity
 h sporadic activity – an isolated case of ILI or 
laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in a limited area
 h local activity – ILI activity above baseline levels with 
laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in a limited area
 h regional activity – outbreaks of ILI or laboratory-
confirmed influenza in one or more regions, with 
the number of cases comprising less than 50% of the 
country’s total population
 h widespread activity – outbreaks of ILI or laboratory-
confirmed influenza in one or more regions, with 
the number of cases comprising  50% or more of the 
country’s population.
Alert thresholds are also used to put a seasonal epidemic 
in historical context, based on average annual incidence 
(9), and to define the severity in terms of transmissibility, 
seriousness of disease and impact.

Influenza
INFLUENZA PANDEMIC
A pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease. 
An influenza pandemic occurs when a new influenza 
virus emerges and spreads around the world, and most 
people do not have immunity to that virus. Triggers 
which should be followed by further investigation are  
as follows:
 h abrupt, unexpected changes in the trend of 
respiratory disease observed in routine surveillance 
systems
 h clusters of severe respiratory disease or pneumonia in 
families, work places, or social networks
 h an increase in absenteeism in schools or workplace 
can signal an influenza outbreak
 h an unexpected pattern of respiratory disease or 
pneumonia such as an increase in apparent mortality, 
a shift in the age group associated with severe 
influenza, or a change in the pattern of clinical 
presentation of influenza-associated disease
 h persistent changes noted in treatment response or 
outcome of severe lower respiratory illness
 h severe, unexplained lower respiratory illness 
occurring in healthcare workers who care for patients 
with respiratory disease
 h unusually high levels of sales of pharmaceuticals used 
for respiratory disease treatment
 h respiratory disease in humans that is associated with 
illness in animals
 h outbreaks of death or illness in fowl (domestic fowl 
or ducks) or other animals (swine, cats, etc.)
 h human cases of infection with a respiratory sample 
that cannot be subtyped, or any influenza virus not 
currently circulating in human populations.
CHANGES TO SURVEILLANCE IN AN OUTBREAK OF 
NOVEL OR VIRULENT SUBTYPE VIRUS
Most programmes will need to make enhancements 
to provide additional critical information in the event 
of a novel influenza virus with sustained community 
transmission. These might include the following:
 h expanded data collection to include additional 
risk factors, additional clinical data on signs and 
symptoms, course of illness, complications and 
outcome
 h admission and discharge diagnoses from severe cases
 h additional monitoring of high-risk populations
 h specific monitoring of intensive care units (ICUs) 
and cases requiring mechanical ventilation
 h collection of mortality data including cause of death.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE
ANIMAL SURVEILLANCE
Influenza A, in particular, is a zoonotic virus that infects 
several animals, including humans, pigs, sea mammals 
and various bird species (10). While animal influenza 
viruses do not transmit readily to humans, they can 
rarely cause disease in humans, either through direct 
transmission from animals or occasional human-to-
human transmission. Some subtypes cause severe disease 
in humans (for example, H5N and H7N9). Disease 
in humans from avian influenza usually occurs in the 
setting of large poultry epidemics. Swine influenza 
viruses more rarely can cause human disease from direct 
transmission. Pigs might also serve as the source of 
mixed human-animal viruses that can become pandemic 
strains, as occurred with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 
epidemic. The goal of surveillance in animals and birds 
is to complement the human surveillance network, 
understand the ecology of influenza viruses that are 
relevant to human and animal health, detect outbreaks 
with potential for human spread, and determine the 
molecular basis of transmission and potential for spread 
to and between humans.
